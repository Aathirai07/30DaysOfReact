Use npm to install the whatwg-fetch library (an implementation of fetch ).
npm install --save whatwg-fetch 

With the library installed, we can make a request to an off-site server. In
order to get access to the fetch library, we'll need to import the package in
our script. 
import React, { Component } from "react";
import "whatwg-fetch";
